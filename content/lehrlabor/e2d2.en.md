quote: "When writing their Bachelor's and Master's theses, students work with empirical data without being introduced to the topic of research data management. Research data management can strengthen aspects such as legal and ethical (CARE principles) framework conditions, open access ideas (FAIR principles) and, in some cases, data analytics skills."

    ## Development of a workshop on the topic of research data management

    As RDM has not yet been offered to students (in a structured way) at the University of Hamburg, the Early Education for Data Management Decisions (E2D2) project aimed to close this gap at the Faculty of Education as an example of best practice. The Early Education for Data Management Decisions (E²D²) workshop held as part of the project was aimed at students of educational science and offered an introduction to research data management.

    *Student teachers' final theses in particular often involve working with personal and sensitive data. This is why RDM skills are particularly relevant for this target group. To evaluate the courses, the students completed pre- and post-surveys to record their level of knowledge and expectations.*

    ## Review and results

    The RDM workshop is a central result of the E2D2 teaching project. *The materials were published transparently with an open license for reuse. They have already been used in a variety of ways. For the accompanying research, interviews were also conducted with lecturers from the EW faculty in order to determine their needs and find out which formats and content could be implemented in existing courses.* In addition, the aim was to record where lecturers would like to receive support with regard to RDM topics. These interviews are currently being qualitatively evaluated and will be published shortly. The excellent networking and, in some cases, close contact between the funded DDLitLab teaching projects creates synergy effects.

    The participating students gave a clearly positive response regarding the relevance of RDM in their studies. The students engaged very well with the RDM content and were highly motivated to transfer the information to their areas of application.

    ## Tips from lecturers for lecturers

    The ZFDM offers events and can be contacted if you are interested. *In principle, the E2D2 teaching materials are structured in such a way that they can be reused easily and intuitively. The slides are reusable and can be adapted.* In addition, teachers are provided with teaching scripts for individual topics to support them in implementing RDM content in their teaching. This means that the results can also be used in the Studium Generale or other subjects at the University of Hamburg (and beyond). Much of the content of the workshops is generally valid and can be taught generically - whereby preparation and adaptation to subject specifics and the infrastructure offers of the respective institution is desired, taking into account current developments in the RDM community.
