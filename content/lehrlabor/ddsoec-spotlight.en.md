    Data is collected almost everywhere and is regarded as an important currency and basis for decision-making in politics and business. *However, drawing meaningful insights from the highly complex data sets that have already been collected is not so easy.*

    Students of sociology, economics and business administration at the University of Hamburg have the opportunity to gain important knowledge in the field of data science in lectures and exercises. Prof Ulrich Fritsche , Lisa Wegner and Victoria Hünewaldt have come up with a concept that allows students to work through the topics at their own pace and in accompanying exercises, learning programming from scratch.

    *The aim is to introduce students to the topic of data science using everyday examples and at their own pace, thereby laying the foundations for their future professional qualifications.*

    The interdisciplinary teaching project "Data Science for Social Scientists and Economists" was successfully implemented in 2023 and 2024 and has been continuously developed ever since. It is funded by the Digital and Data Literacy in Teaching Lab (DDLitLab for short) and is offered for various degree programmes at the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Hamburg.
