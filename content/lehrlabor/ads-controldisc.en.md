quote: "A critical evaluation of the current Teaching Lab project also indicates that, by foregrounding the focus on data literacy, mainly intrinsically motivated students with a pre-existing interest in data literacy are addressed. Many students in English linguistics are reluctant to engage with data-intensive methods. A new approach is needed to reach these students."

    ## Orientation of the project

    The development of the project idea for the teaching project "Applying Data Science to Controversial Discourses" was motivated by several insights and considerations. Firstly, there was a need for a critical evaluation of the existing teaching lab on advanced data analysis for linguists from the first round of DDLitLab funding. Although this lab was successful and attracted a significant number of students with an intrinsic interest in data literacy, it was found that many students in English linguistics were reluctant to engage with data-intensive methods. This led to the realisation that a new approach was needed to reach those students who were previously reluctant to engage with data analysis. The idea of introducing controversial discourse as a central element was born out of the consideration that these topics have a broad resonance and could therefore also appeal to students who had previously shown little interest in data literacy.

    *Furthermore, weaknesses in the data literacy training of students were identified, particularly in the areas of data analysis and data application. This realisation was directly incorporated into the design of the new seminars, which focus on the interpretation of findings from large data corpora, particularly social media and newspaper corpora. Statistical, data-intensive analysis techniques are used to familiarise students with complex aspects of data literacy.*

    ## Review and results

    A key achievement of the teaching project was to motivate students to become data literate by integrating controversial discourses - in particular through the seminars "Understanding the Dynamics of COVID-19 Discourse" and "Climate Change Discourse: Between Global Catastrophe and Business as Usual". This approach helped to lower the inhibition threshold towards data analyses and promote interest.

    *The innovative idea was to embed data literacy in broader societal discourses rather than teaching in isolation. This promoted both technical skills and the ability to think critically about relevant topics and interpret data. To summarise, the teaching project successfully increased student interest and data analysis skills and laid the foundation for a long-term integration of data literacy at the Institute of English Studies at Universität Hamburg.*

    Specific RStudio workbooks have been developed to provide students with a structured approach to data analysis concepts and techniques. These hands-on workbooks include theoretical explanations, practical examples and exercises that ensure an effective learning process and enable students to understand and apply advanced data analysis methods.

    ## Tips from lecturers for lecturers

    As part of the project, the digital and didactic skills of teachers were developed in various ways. On the one hand, digital skills were expanded and deepened through the use of digital tools and methods. This experience and knowledge can now also be used and passed on in other courses. In addition, didactic skills were also further developed as part of the project by reflecting on the seminars together with the students and adapting them to their needs. Experience has shown that students particularly benefit from interactive teaching methods and practical exercises and that learning is promoted through application in real research projects. Through self-analysis as a teacher, teaching strategies could also be reconsidered and optimised in order to achieve better communication of the content and greater student motivation.
