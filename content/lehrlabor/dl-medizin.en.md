    ## Future topic: data literacy in medicine

    Students who later work as doctors have the lifelong task of critically classifying new medical findings and incorporating them into their treatment practice. This course introduces medical and dental students to methodological knowledge of medical research and focuses in particular on the competence of evidence evaluation. This basic knowledge was taught in lectures. In addition, seminars were held in which students could experience statistical concepts in practice by collecting and evaluating their own data. In addition, a critical view of the content and methodology of scientific publications was practiced by working on current literature.

    Additional learning resources were also created for the students as part of the project. Additional learning and practice opportunities were created on the iMED-Textbook learning platform used by the UKE, e.g. with the help of self-produced educational videos or podcasts.

    ## Review and results

    *By teaching the new concept, dental students have acquired the competence to analyze data and, above all, to interpret and critically question analysis results.* Doctors fulfill different roles and the most relevant for data literacy education is that of the doctor as a scholar. The project has contributed to preparing students for this role, which requires them to integrate scientific evidence into their later treatments and to inform themselves about scientific developments and critically evaluate this information.

    The digital learning resource iMed-Textbook is a learning resource that is intended to accompany students at various points during their medical studies and can be expanded to include further content. The study sheet resulting from the project makes it possible to critically evaluate medical studies in terms of methodology and can be used in other courses. *The project has thus produced results that can be built on in future semesters and possibly other courses. There are also plans to expand the digital learning offer to include statistical software and make it publicly accessible so that medical students at other universities can also access it. The national catalogs of learning objectives in medicine, which are currently being revised, call for a stronger scientific focus.*

    ## Tips from lecturers for lecturers

    Through the online learning experience under pandemic conditions, many students have come to appreciate the advantages of the "discussed PowerPoint" teaching format (free time management, repetition, fast lead time, etc.) to such an extent that they see no benefit in a live presence lecture. Lecturers (especially in the free elective area) must therefore make fundamental considerations about the format of their courses, taking into account the time commitment and the circumstances of the respective degree program. Such complex seminars require free capacities of the students.
