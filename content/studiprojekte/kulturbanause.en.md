    The KulturBanause project aims to make Hamburg's cultural offerings more accessible. To achieve this, we are developing a mobile application that allows people to discover new events as groups of friends. Until now, much information about event offerings has only been available decentrally and via various channels. This makes it difficult for the offerings to reach their target audiences. Furthermore, it can be challenging for a group to find events that are geographically accessible for all participants. This is particularly important in a city as large as Hamburg.

    Thanks to the City of Hamburg's open data approach, we have access to a high-quality database of current events of various categories. We prepare these and make them available via a web application. Users can learn about events in groups and make a selection together. We use statistical methods and processed geo- and traffic data to predict the accessibility of the event for all participants.

    We are implementing the project in three phases:

    1. The first phase includes interviews with experts and the identification of requirements and user preferences.
    2. In the second phase, we design the software solution and develop a prototype, which is made available to users.
    3. The third phase involves evaluation through user testing, whose feedback will be incorporated into the further development of the application.

    The project is based on open data from the City of Hamburg, which is why the developed project is being made available to the public as an open-source solution on the GitHub platform.
