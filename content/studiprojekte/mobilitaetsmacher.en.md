    A significant proportion of Hamburg's population lives in districts that are *not sufficiently integrated into the HVV network* [1]. Furthermore, studies by the Hamburg University of Technology show that the per capita availability of buses and rapid transit services is significantly lower in low-income areas compared to districts with higher purchasing power [2]. The recently introduced financial support for the use of services provided by Deutsche Bahn and the Hamburg Transport Association (HVV) has relieved the burden on low-income households [3]. However, even this financial support does not solve the problem of the lack of connection of low-income (peripheral) areas to the mobility network.

    Access to public transport is essential for *social participation*, which can manifest itself through maintaining social contacts, personal development, or participation in cultural and political life [3]. Mobility restrictions, such as long waiting times, frequent transfers, or poor connections, can therefore lead to social isolation. In order to promote social participation, especially for marginalized groups, a well-functioning transport network in the city is essential. 

    Our project aims to conduct a data-driven analysis of how HVV services differ between Hamburg's various districts. We therefore plan to evaluate individual stops within Hamburg's public transport system. Using HVV timetable data, we will algorithmically determine the catchment areas of each stop and visualize them. In doing so, we will consider that good mobility access requires not only a nearby stop, but also *high frequency and adequate capacity utilization*.

    Furthermore, *travel times to social participation sites* will be calculated to enable comparability between different stops. The results will be presented as a map of Hamburg and serve as a starting point for realistic optimizations using machine learning algorithms. The research results can be used by our cooperation partner, the HVV, to obtain an overview of poorly connected districts in Hamburg. Furthermore, the map will be made available to the public so that every citizen can learn about the district's connectivity.
