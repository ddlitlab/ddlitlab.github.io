    ## The project CROSPER

    In order to develop the ability to illustrate, analyze and consequently normatively evaluate complex ecosystems, architectural knowledge is first taught in this project. The architectural knowledge to be imparted takes into account complex constellations of actors in which data is exchanged and algorithmic systems are used. Modeling with the help of architectures thus creates the basis for illustrating ecosystems and thus the transparency of complex systems. In addition, media law knowledge is imparted to assess these ecosystems and the problems and challenges they present. The original plan to test a course could not be carried out. Instead, a learning environment was set up that can be used in the coming semesters.

    ## Review and results

    *In essence, a learning environment was developed in an interdisciplinary collaboration between business IT specialists and lawyers. This learning environment guides students and interdisciplinary research teams step-by-step through the process of exploring media ecosystems and is intended to help interdisciplinary teams develop a common language.*

    To this end, people are first introduced to the Google News Case. Based on this, the modeling procedure is presented. In particular, model stories should help people to take their first steps in modeling media ecosystems and, for example, to translate legal terms or everyday concepts into architectural terms. Based on the model stories, people are then instructed to look for appropriate sources depending on their information needs and to gradually develop and reflect on the architectural models.

    *This approach is intended to encourage them to analyze interwoven ecosystems more closely and to understand the relationships between actors, data and systems in the context of media regulatory issues.*

    ## Tips from lecturers for lecturers

    On the one hand, other mechanisms are needed in the free elective area to make courses interesting for students. All-day events during semester breaks do not appear to be a suitable format. In addition to learning content, it is important to strengthen digital and interactive learning environments. User guidance in particular is important to enable students to navigate the platform independently. The development of a low-threshold approach that is not only interesting for lawyers and computer scientists is recommended. This could focus on how services such as Google News work and what social challenges and opportunities this presents. A change of perspective can be an important stylistic element in teaching.
