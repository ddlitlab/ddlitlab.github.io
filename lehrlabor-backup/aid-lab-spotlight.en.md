    AI crash course for student teachers and pupils in year 8: concepts such as "AI Unplugged" enable not only secondary school pupils but also student teachers of all subjects to learn valuable knowledge about how AI works. In co-creation, small research projects are also created in which the knowledge learnt is directly applied.

    In this interview, Moritz Kreinsen tells us about his teaching project ‘Teacher AID Lab - Interdisciplinary AI + Data Lab in Teacher Education’, which was funded by the Digital and Data Literacy in Teaching Lab (DDLitLab for short) in 2023 and 2024 and carried out at the Faculty of Education at the University of Hamburg and the Schülerforschungszentrum Hamburg.

    *The aim: to give Master's degree students in all subjects a quick introduction to the basics of AI and also to encourage them to gain practical experience working with pupils beyond the usual internships.*
