    ## Orientation of the Digital Causality Lab

    Causal inference can be a lot of fun, and students should be taught this. In addition, the methods for analyzing causal relationships are much easier to understand if they are applied independently. The theoretical approaches are always used for practical application. This is how the idea of creating a causal lab was born, in which students have the opportunity to try things out, collect ideas and, if necessary, discard them and ultimately come up with their own solutions. 

    ## Review and results

    In the course of the project, a modern and innovative course in the context of causality was created. The lecture was supplemented by interactive learning materials (learning apps), which contributed to a better understanding of the theoretical content. With the Digital Causality Lab, which replaces the previous frontally taught exercise, an innovative learning space with a didactic focus on research-based learning was also established. *On the one hand, important practical tools and skills of data literacy are taught in the Digital Causality Lab, and the theoretical concepts from the lecture are applied in practice. On the other hand, students deepen this knowledge in the course of causal case studies in which they independently develop a data product.*

    *The course "Causal Inference and Digital Causality Lab" will become an integral part of the curriculum (B.Sc. Business Administration and related degree programs) and will be offered regularly as a hybrid course in the summer semester. We will also offer a fully digital version of the course (MOOC). This will then be aimed at a broad audience as part of the Studium Generale.*

    Added value was also created for future teaching projects. On the one hand, new didactic concepts were developed and tested and, on the other, the topic of data literacy was established as a dedicated teaching focus for the first time. In addition, many learning materials were created and shared online. An important part of the project is based on open source software development, which means that the source code for numerous learning materials (e.g. the learning apps) is freely available.

    ## Tips from lecturers for lecturers

    The topic of data literacy will generally have to be given greater importance in future courses. Frontal teaching scenarios are often not suitable for conveying learning content and skills. In future, an interactive and collaborative teaching approach and elements of research-based learning must be used more frequently. In addition, interactive learning apps should be used more frequently as teaching materials in statistics courses in the future. The project has had very good experiences with them in teaching.
