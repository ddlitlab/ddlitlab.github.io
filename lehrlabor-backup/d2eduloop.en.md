    ## Orientation of the project

    The goal of the project ist the development of concrete measures for the implementation of a coordinated, systematically structured DDLE courses, in accordance with the Digital Strategy for Studies & Teaching of the Faculty of Education, and coordination with relevant DDLE stakeholders within the Faculty of Education. The project will be realised as follows:

    - Survey and categorization of existing DDLE courses and identification of key stakeholders within the Faculty of Education who have developed and conducted DDLE courses.

    - Support for the establishment of cooperation and communication structures for the long-term coordination of DDLE courses within the Faculty of Education.

    - Identification of relevant stakeholders for transfer-oriented activities in the cross-phase teacher education.

    - Further development of a coordinated, systematically structured DDLE courses for the Faculty of Education.

    ## Seminar: Digital + Data + 'AI' Literacy and the Transformation of Learning

    *A seminar is also part of the project. The aim is to promote digital, data and ‘AI’ literacy among students of educational science and teachers, as well as to exchange and reflect on the impact on the transformation of learning in schools.*

    The seminar is a cooperation between the EW Faculty of the University of Hamburg and the State Institute for Teacher Training and School Development (LI), in consultation with representatives of the Hamburg Student Council (SKH). The seminar takes place weekly and is also open to teachers as an in-service training programme. Students of educational sciences learn the basics of digital, data and ‘AI’ skills together with teachers and discuss and reflect together on the resulting transformation of learning in schools. Together, they develop Open Educational Resources (OER) for ‘corresponding services with digital components’.

    *The OER are published on the digital.learning.lab platform.*
