    ## Orientation of the project

    The goal of the seminar “BreAkIng Bad - Hacking the AI Act” was to raise awareness of the risks of (generative) AI and to teach a critical approach towards AI in terms of opportunities and risks before the background of the current legal developments (EU AI Act) in a practical way. *As part of this follow-up project, the content developed during the project seminar will be modularized and integrated into existing courses and seminars.*

    ## Project realisation

    The modularization and integration of the project will be achieved as follows:

    - Reviewing courses in which the content from BreAkIng Bad can be integrated. Coordination with lecturers regarding the objectives, the students' prior knowledge and the requirements for the teaching materials – the overarching goal is (and remains) to raise awareness for the tension between business opportunities and (ethical and legal) risks when using (generative) AI

    - Modularization of the existing concept and materials and further development according to the new format (according to the requirements of the lecturers and based on feedback from the previous seminar)

    - Support lecturers in integrating the modular content into their courses
